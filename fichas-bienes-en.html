                    <strong>Origin:</strong>
                    <p>Main global exporters (2023): Brazil (leader, ~30% of supply), Vietnam (2nd, Robusta), Colombia (3rd, Arabica, with a drop in 2023 due to rain and costs), Indonesia (4th), Honduras (largest producer in Central America), Ethiopia, Uganda, India, Mexico, and Peru. Production is sensitive to climatic factors. [15, 60, 61]</p>

                    <strong>Industrial Packaging and Maritime Transport:</strong>
                    <p>Predominant transport in 20-foot containers (net weight ~17,250 kg). Packaging methods for green coffee:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>**Jute or Burlap Sacks:** Traditional method, 100% biodegradable and recyclable. Each sack stores 60-69 kg (approx. 300 sacks/container, ~18 tons). [58, 18]</li>
                        <li>**Big Bags:** Made of polyethylene or polypropylene, store 900-1,000 kg per bag (19-20 tons/container). More economical and moisture-resistant than jute, though still permeable. [18]</li>
                        <li>**High-Barrier Sacks:** Made with low-permeability materials (plastic, metallized, paper, aluminum) for an impenetrable barrier against water vapor, oxygen, and light. [18]</li>
                        <li>**TranSafeliner:** Internal container linings that protect coffee quality during maritime transit, preventing oxidation and mold. [62, 63, 42]</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Protection against moisture and condensation is critical due to long maritime journeys. The use of hermetic packaging is vital. Flexitanks are not suitable for transporting coffee beans. [58, 18, 62, 63, 42]</p>

                <div>
                    <strong>Product:</strong>
                    <p>Dry, whole bean. For optimal cultivation, it requires average temperatures of 25-26°C, annual rainfall of 1500-3000 mm, and gentle winds (<14 km/h). Clean cocoa is stored in natural fiber (jute) sacks or food-grade sacks, new and dry. Shelf life of up to 2 years under suitable conditions. [64, 19, 65, 66, 52, 63]</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <strong>Quality for Export:</strong>
                    <p>Quality control is critical, with analyses based on specific standards (e.g., INEN 175, 176, 177 in Ecuador). Rigorous physicochemical parameters:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>**Moisture:** Maximum 7%. [64, 52]</li>
                        <li>**Impurities:** Maximum 1%. [64, 52]</li>
                        <li>**Molds:** Must not exceed 2 beans per 100 beans. [64, 52]</li>
                        <li>**Damaged by Insects, Broken, Germinated:** Maximum 1 bean per 100 beans. [64, 52]</li>
                        <li>**Bean Count:** Maximum acceptance value of 4% by count. [14.1, 124]</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Cocoa is hygroscopic and sensitive to temperature and humidity changes, which can cause caking and mold. Optimal transport temperature is between 15 and 25°C. The **Regulations for Good Cocoa Storage and Marketing Practices (BPACC)** are fundamental to ensuring quality and safety. [51, 71, 72, 73, 14.2, 49]</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <strong>Origin:</strong>
                    <p>Africa dominates world production (70%), with Côte d'Ivoire (leader, ~38% global) and Ghana (2nd) as main exporters. Other key exporters include Ecuador, Cameroon, Nigeria, Peru (fine and sustainable cocoa), and the Dominican Republic (leader in organic cocoa). Exports have been affected by extreme weather conditions (irregular rainfall, heatwaves, droughts). [15.1, 15.2, 75, 76, 108, 129]</p>

                <div>
                    <strong>Industrial Packaging and Maritime Transport:</strong>
                    <p>Predominant transport in 20-foot containers. Primary packaging for grain is in 60 kg jute sacks. [64, 7, 52]</p>
                    <p>To protect cocoa from moisture and temperature changes, **thermal solutions** are used:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>**Embatuff thermal liner:** Thermal lining for the interior of maritime containers. [67, 48]</li>
                        <li>**Embacover:** Isothermal insulator for palletized products. [67, 48]</li>
                        <li>**Isothermal box liners.** [67, 48]</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These solutions provide thermal protection, moisture control (insulating from "container rain"), and isolation from odors/dirt. For organic cocoa transport, many importers require **ventilated or highly ventilated containers**. Palletization is a common practice, with pallet stacking heights not exceeding 2.00 meters. Flexitanks are not suitable for transporting cocoa beans. [68, 67, 69, 7, 48, 43]</p>
